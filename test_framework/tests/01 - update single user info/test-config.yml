user_sync:
    # (required) arguments (no default value)
    # Defines the arguments used when invoking the user-sync tool. The relative path in this argument is relative to
    # working directory defined below.
    arguments: -c ../config/user-sync-config.yml --update-user-info --users file ../config/users.csv

    # Defines settings for test framework running in live mode.
    live:
        # (optional) working_dir (default value "live")
        # Working directory that the user-sync tool is set to when it is invoked at the start of the test.
        working_dir: live

        # (optional) output_dir (default value "live/out")
        # Directory that will be considered the output folder. Typically when specifying user-sync output arguments for
        # the test cases you would place it in an output folder, such as user-sync "--adobe-only-user-action
        # write-file out/test.csv". By default, the user-sync output will be written to live/out/out.txt, unless
        # this output folder or working folder is changed.
        # TODO: instead of specifying the output folder, this parameter will be renamed output_filename, which would
        # default to out/out.txt, and 
        output_dir: live/out

    recorded:
        # (optional) working_dir (default value "rec")
        # Same as /user_sync/live/working_dir, but represents the working directory for when running in the framework
        # recorded mode instead of live mode.
        working_dir: rec

        # (optional) output_dir (default value "rec/out")
        # Same as /user_sync/live/output_dir, but represents the output directory for when running the framework in
        # recorded mode.
        output_dir: rec/out

server:
    # (optional) cassette_filename (default value "live/cassette.yml")
    # Cassette file that will be used by the proxy server when recording requests/responses when running the framework
    # in live mode, or for matching requests and returning responses to the user-sync tool when the framework is in
    # recorded mode.
    cassette_filename: live/cassette.yml
